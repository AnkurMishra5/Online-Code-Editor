**Online Code Editor**
Online Code Editor is a web-based code editor that allows users to write, edit, and preview HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in real-time. This project is a simple but functional coding environment developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Project Overview**
The editor is divided into two sections:

Editor Pane: Allows users to type their code.
Preview Pane: Displays the output of the code in real-time.
This editor currently only displays content written inside the <body> tag, although code written in other tags (such as <style> or <script>) affects the output.

**Features**
Real-Time Preview: See changes in real-time as you type code.
Simple Layout: An intuitive interface for easy coding and testing.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript Support: Write and view code in these languages.

**Technology Stack**
HTML: Structure of the editor interface.
CSS: Styling for a clean and user-friendly design.
JavaScript: Real-time updating and functionality.
